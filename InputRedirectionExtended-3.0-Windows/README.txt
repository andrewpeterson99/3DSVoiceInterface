*General*
-Fixed timing issues, controls being sent to 3ds is 
now sent every 20 ms using another thread. 
Much less to no lag on 3ds and computer.
-Added Mac OSx support 
(Must install gamepad drivers separately)

*Shortcut Menu*
What's a shortcut?
This menu allows you to map touchpad points to special 'shortcuts' which can be mapped
to a controller button or not. Immediately after creating, a dot will
appear on the touchpad showing where it was made. 
Note: These can be really small (3px.) resize the touchpad if you can't see them. 

How to Use:
Right click on the touch pad and select 'Set Point to Button...'.
Wherever you right-click, that point will be stored and when the shortcut menu
opens, this point will be displayed in the title bar.

After verifying the position in the title bar, you can now create a shortcut
which have the following options:
    -Name (Required)
	-Button, shortcut can be mapped to button or nothing (See Below)
	-Color, used for the 'dots' only (Optional)

After filling in these options, press create to create the shortcut.

Select your shortcut in the list and press "Press Selected Shortcut", this will click the currently
selected shortcut on the 3ds to test it.

*Settings Menu*
Here you can map your controller buttons, adjust stick ranges (useful for custom controllers),
invert sticks, swap sticks, and other specific game tweaks. Make sure to press save at the bottom.
